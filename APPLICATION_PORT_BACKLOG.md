# Unified Application Port Backlog

Snapshot date: **9 October 2026**

Primary target: **AmigaChrome AC090 / AmigaOS 3.x / 68040 + FPU**

This is the single non-game application-port backlog for AmigaChrome. The **Category** column groups ports by application type so the catalogue can be reviewed by domain as well as priority. Emulators, emulator frontends and compatibility runtimes live with games in `amigachrome-gameports`. It combines fresh candidates with AROS, classic AmigaOS, AmigaOS 4 and MorphOS prior art so priority decisions can be made from the whole field.

Priority scale:

- **P0** — finish / enable now
- **P1** — next delivery wave
- **P2** — planned
- **P3** — stretch
- **PARK** — research / low return for now

## Governing porting rule

Application-port work should be preceded by one question:

> **What need does this remove to use another platform for?**

The highest-value ports are the ones that let an AmigaChrome user complete a real task end-to-end without switching to Linux, Windows, macOS or another machine. A port should therefore justify itself in terms of the external workflow it replaces, not merely because the upstream application is technically interesting.

Examples:

- FFmpeg / OpenTranscode -> removes the need to use another platform for media conversion and delivery encoding.
- OpenAudioEdit / SoX -> removes the need to use another platform for recording, trimming and restoring audio.
- GrafX2 / image tools -> removes the need to use another platform for creating and processing graphics.
- OpenRecorder -> removes the need to use another platform for screen and audio capture.
- Vim / developer tooling -> removes the need to use another platform for editing and maintaining source code.
- PDF/document tools -> removes the need to use another platform for routine document viewing, conversion and output.

This **platform-substitution value** should be assessed before engineering effort begins.

A successful compile is not a release. RELEASE still requires reproducible provenance, the approved GCC stove, packaging and AC090 runtime qualification.

Use the AmigaChrome removable/block-device abstraction for SD/USB; delegate CD/DVD ISO burning to the FryingPan/optical backend rather than duplicating burner code | Define device-selection safety contract, write and verify one .IMG to removable flash media, then burn one .ISO through the shared optical backend |

### Communications ownership

**OpenBrowser**, **OpenMail**, **OpenFTP/OpenFiles** and **OpenPuTTY** already own the main communications workflows:

- web browsing -> OpenBrowser;
- mail -> OpenMail;
- file transfer -> OpenFTP/OpenFiles;
- SSH, Telnet, raw and serial terminal access -> OpenPuTTY;
- networking and secure transport -> OpenSocket/OpenTLS/OpenCrypto.

OpenPuTTY is already a working AmigaOS 3.2.x application and should remain the remote-shell/terminal product. Applicationports should not create a competing SSH terminal unless a genuinely distinct workflow emerges.

### Missing-workflow rule

When no credible port exists, record the **workflow gap** rather than naming a fashionable heavyweight application. A new Open-family application may be the better answer when it can reuse existing OpenWrite, OpenView, OpenPrint, DataTypes, OpenGPU, OpenAudio, OpenMedia and OpenMulticore services.

### Developer-tool ownership

- **OpenEdit** is the primary native source/text editor; another editor must offer a distinct workflow rather than duplicate basic editing.
- **OpenAmigaGCC 16.2** is the compiler baseline, including ACKitchenB.
- **ACKitchen/Build Lab** owns the integrated build/debug experience and may use the 64-192-core host environment for compilation and analysis.
- Applicationports should fill missing *user workflows* around that stack: source control, scripting, specialist editors and reusable build-time libraries.

### Removable image-writing rule

**OpenImageWriter** owns writing complete disk/media images to removable targets. Its core path is raw `.IMG`/`.ISO` writing to SD cards and USB/removable block devices with explicit device identity, capacity checks, progress and read-back verification. Optical CD/DVD writing should reuse the shared FryingPan/optical transport instead of creating a second burner implementation.

Safety is part of the product contract: fixed/system disks must not be casually selectable, target identity and size must be shown before writing, destructive writes require explicit confirmation, and verification should be offered by default.

### Storage and optical rule

Optical/media tools should solve a complete workflow, not merely expose a library. **FryingPan** is the preferred user-facing CD/DVD authoring candidate. **xorriso** is useful as an ISO/image backend. Physical-drive burning on AmigaChrome must go through an explicit Amiga/host optical transport rather than bypassing the platform abstraction.

### Office and document ownership

- **OpenWrite** owns word processing and document conversion/editing; do not revive standalone Word converters that duplicate it.
- **OpenBase** owns database/application-builder work; MUIbase remains prior art, not a competing shipping target.
- **opendoc.datatype** owns broad document viewing through the service path, including DOCX/XLSX/PPTX/OpenDocument and legacy office formats.
- **OpenPrint** owns PDF creation/printing; **OpenView + MuPDF** should own full PDF reading.
- Spreadsheet editing remains a real gap: **Ignition** is the preferred revival candidate.
- Presentation editing remains a real gap: **OpenPresent** is the native product target unless a suitable open-source Amiga-family editor emerges.

### Graphics product rule

- **OpenView/DataTypes own viewing**, so a separate image-viewer port is not maintained here.
- Prefer **one strong tool per workflow** over multiple overlapping paint/processing packages.
- Vector editing is a real workflow gap; MorphOS VectorInk/Method Draw prior art is preferred over carrying a heavyweight modern GTK/Qt desktop stack onto 68k.
- Offline rendering is especially valuable on AmigaChrome because OpenMulticore can expose the expected 64-192 host cores.

### Media playback ownership

Routine media playback is not an application-port backlog item. **OpenPlay** is the native datatype-driven player and **OpenAmigaVLC** is a separate existing project that drives OpenMedia. Applicationports should only add another playback application when it closes a workflow that those two cannot reasonably cover.

### Video product rule

**OpenTranscode**, **OpenRecorder**, **OpenVideoEdit** and **OpenAmigaVLC** are the user-facing video products. HandBrake/libhb, historical AROS ScreenRecorder code and MPlayer are reference/engine prior art rather than separate shipping targets unless a later gap justifies reviving them directly.

### Audio editing product rule

**OpenAudioEdit** is the shipping audio-editor target. Audacity is a workflow and feature reference, not a port target. Reuse portable algorithms/libraries where licences and architecture make sense, but do not import a heavyweight desktop GUI/toolkit merely to preserve the Audacity application shell.

### Audio codec scope rule

Do not turn every codec supported by FFmpeg into a separate port project. Add a standalone codec/library only when it provides at least one of:

- a materially smaller/lighter native dependency than FFmpeg;
- a common upstream dependency for several applications;
- useful native CLI tooling;
- significantly better encode/decode quality or performance for its format;
- existing Amiga-family prior art worth reviving.

Formats such as WavPack, ALAC and other less-common codecs should normally be served through FFmpeg unless a consuming application gives us a concrete reason to maintain their native libraries separately.

## Create versus fold-in rule

Every candidate must state whether it should:

- **CREATE** — become a distinct user-facing application with its own workflow and identity;
- **FOLD INTO** — become capability inside an existing Open application/service;
- **CREATE / standalone revival** — remain recognisably the upstream application because that identity/workflow has value;
- **FOLD INTO + keep CLI** — provide reusable infrastructure to Open apps while retaining useful command-line tools.

Prefer folding capabilities into coherent products when a standalone application would merely duplicate an existing Open-family workflow.

## Platform ownership: OpenMedia and DataTypes

Before adding a media port, check whether the requirement is already satisfied by the AmigaChrome media platform:

- **OpenMedia** owns hardware video codec sessions and zero-copy surfaces: H.264, HEVC, VP9, AV1, MPEG-2, VC-1 and JPEG, with decode/encode capability depending on the provider.
- **OpenAmigaMediaLibrary** already has working AC090-tested libwebp 1.6.0 and libvpx 1.17.0 decoder builds.
- **openpicture.datatype** covers AVIF, HEIC/HEIF, JPEG XL, RAW, PSD, XCF, EXR, HDR, QOI, DDS, JPEG 2000, OpenRaster, Krita, CBZ, SVG and more through `media.decode/1`.
- **opensound.datatype** covers FLAC, Ogg/Vorbis, Opus, AAC/M4A, ALAC, WMA, MP3, MIDI, SID and module formats through `media.decode/1`.
- **openmodule.datatype** plays module formats locally using libxmp, with an OpenMulticore/offload ladder.
- **openvideo.datatype** covers MP4/MOV, MKV, AVI, WMV, MPEG, FLV and APNG through `media.decode/1`.
- **webp.datatype** and **webm.datatype** provide local WebP and VP8/VP9 paths.
- **OpenPlay** is already the user-facing datatype-driven media player.

Therefore, a codec/library does **not** get a standalone application-port row merely because a media format exists. Add it only when creation/editing/encoding, a concrete consuming application, or a material performance/compatibility reason requires a native library.

## Scale assumption: 64-192 host cores

AmigaChrome application ports should assume that the surrounding host environment may expose **64 to 192 CPU cores** through OpenMulticore.

This does not mean every legacy application should be naively threaded. It means the port intake should explicitly identify work that can be parallelised or offloaded safely:

- media encode/decode pipelines;
- rendering and ray tracing;
- audio analysis, conversion and restoration;
- compression/decompression;
- image batch processing;
- build/compile workloads;
- transcoding queues and independent jobs;
- background indexing, OCR and document conversion.

Where upstream already uses pthreads, worker pools, task graphs or job queues, prefer mapping those onto OpenMulticore rather than serialising them for AmigaOS. Where a workload is embarrassingly parallel, the Amiga UI process should remain responsive while the heavy work is distributed across the available host cores.

The target is therefore **Amiga semantics at the application boundary, modern parallel execution underneath**.

## Priority lens

Before assigning engineering time, rank each candidate on:

- **Platform substitution value** — how much it removes the need to use another platform.
- **User value** — how useful the completed workflow is.
- **Probability of success** — likelihood of reaching useful first light on AC090.
- **Reuse value** — whether the port unlocks multiple applications or workflows.
- **Open-family value** — whether it proves or strengthens OpenMedia, OpenAudio, OpenGPU, OpenInput, OpenMulticore, OpenPrint or related services.
- **Parallel scale value** — whether useful work can exploit the expected 64-192 core host environment through OpenMulticore or independent job execution.
- **Effort** — engineering and maintenance cost.
- **Dependency friction** — external libraries/toolchains required first.
- **Workflow completeness** — whether the result solves the whole user task or only one fragment of it.

A technically impressive port that still forces the user onto another platform to finish the job should normally rank below a smaller port that closes a complete workflow.

## Standard intake rule

Before writing Amiga portability code for any application:

1. inspect AROS Contrib and AROS Ports;
2. inspect Aminet and classic AmigaOS source/patches;
3. inspect OS4Depot;
4. inspect MorphOS Storage;
5. inspect current upstream;
6. identify which historical patches are still relevant;
7. map graphics/audio/input/media/threading to Open-family interfaces;
8. pin source and produce a reproducible GCC16 build recipe.

## Porting styles

Every backlog item should eventually be classified as one of:

- **Native revival** — retain the original application's UI and port it cleanly.
- **Engine + Open UI** — reuse portable core functionality but build a native AmigaChrome UI.
- **CLI foundation** — expose a command-line engine/tool first.
- **Open service client** — make expensive work use OpenMedia/OpenGPU/OpenAudio/OpenMulticore.
- **Prior-art only** — mine old Amiga-family patches without shipping that historical application.
